# Assignment: Analysis of Real World Spark Cluster Data



## Guidelines

Brief description of your approach for each problem
   - Key findings and insights from the data
   - Performance observations (execution time, optimizations)
   - Screenshots of Spark Web UI showing job execution
   - Explanation of the visualizations generated in Problem 2


## Key Findings 

- Across 33.2M log lines, we found 27.4M that had log levels 
- We found three unique log level values with "INFO" accounting for 99.92% of all log levels


## Performance Observations

- The execution time with the entire dataset and utilizing the spark cluster can still be substantial leading to errors being costly
- Testing locally on a sample of the data is import due to the performance and time considerations

## Visualizations
